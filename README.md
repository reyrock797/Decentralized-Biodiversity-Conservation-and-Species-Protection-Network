# Decentralized Biodiversity Conservation and Species Protection Network

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing biodiversity conservation efforts, species protection, and ecosystem preservation using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## System Overview

This network consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to create a decentralized platform for biodiversity conservation:

### 1. Genetic Diversity Preservation Contract (`genetic-diversity.clar`)
- Maintains digital records of seed banks and genetic repositories
- Tracks genetic samples and their storage locations
- Manages access permissions for research institutions
- Records genetic diversity metrics and conservation status

### 2. Wildlife Corridor Establishment Contract (`wildlife-corridors.clar`)
- Creates and manages protected pathways for animal migration
- Tracks corridor usage and effectiveness
- Manages land acquisition and protection agreements
- Monitors corridor connectivity and habitat quality

### 3. Invasive Species Management Contract (`invasive-species.clar`)
- Identifies and tracks invasive species populations
- Manages control and eradication programs
- Coordinates response efforts across regions
- Tracks treatment effectiveness and population changes

### 4. Endangered Species Recovery Contract (`endangered-species.clar`)
- Implements targeted conservation programs for threatened species
- Tracks population recovery metrics
- Manages breeding programs and habitat restoration
- Coordinates conservation efforts across stakeholders

### 5. Ecosystem Service Valuation Contract (`ecosystem-services.clar`)
- Quantifies economic value of ecosystem services
- Manages payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs
- Tracks carbon sequestration, water purification, and biodiversity metrics
- Facilitates compensation for conservation efforts

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making for conservation priorities
- **Transparent Tracking**: Immutable records of all conservation activities and outcomes
- **Incentive Mechanisms**: Token-based rewards for successful conservation efforts
- **Data Integrity**: Blockchain-secured storage of critical biodiversity data
- **Stakeholder Coordination**: Unified platform for researchers, conservationists, and policymakers

## Contract Architecture

Each contract operates independently while maintaining data consistency through standardized data structures and validation mechanisms. The system uses native Clarity features for:

- Data storage and retrieval
- Access control and permissions
- Event logging and monitoring
- Error handling and validation
- Token-based incentive distribution

## Getting Started

1. Install Clarinet CLI
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `clarinet check` to validate contracts
4. Run `npm test` to execute the test suite
5. Deploy contracts using `clarinet deploy`

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests using Vitest to ensure contract functionality, data integrity, and proper error handling across all conservation scenarios.
